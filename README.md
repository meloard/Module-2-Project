Module 2 Assignment - Build a personal portfolio webpage without starter code




This is an introductory look at creating a portfolio page using both html and css.


A portfolio page can be a very useful tool to show others the projects I have worked on, and more broadly, a way to connect with other people in the industry. This is my first attempt at creating a web page, and while there is tremendous room for improvement, it is rewarding to see a page created for the first time entirely from code I wrote. Working with both HTML and CSS helped me understand the written structures, like semantic elements in HTML and flex-box properties in CSS.
